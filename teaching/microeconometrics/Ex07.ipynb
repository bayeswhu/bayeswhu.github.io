First, use weighted regression with the weight=1/varu, as in the lecture. Second, manually implement this regression by generating the transformed variable $tr\\_y=\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{varu}}$ and regressing `tr_y` on the similarly constructed variables `tr_x2`, `tr_x3`, and `tr_one`, using regression without constant."

    "Consider the same DGP as that in Exercise 1. Given this specification of the model, the rescaled equation $y/w = \\beta_1(1/w) + \\beta_2(x_2/w) + \\beta_3(x_3/w) + e$, where $w = \\sqrt{\\exp(-1+0.2*x_2)}$, will have the error e, which is normally distributed and homoskedastic. Treat w as known and estimate this rescaled regression by using regression without constant term. Compare the results with those given in Exercise 1, where the weight w was estimated. Is there a big difference here between the GLS and FGLS estimators?"

Then FGLS estimates can be obtained by using regression with weight=1/x2sq, where $x2sq=x2^2$ and computer robust standard error. How different are the estimates of $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2 , \\beta_3)$ from the OLS results? Do the standard errors change much if robust standard errors are computed? Use the Breuschâ€“Pagan test to check whether the regression errors in the transformed model are homoskedastic."
