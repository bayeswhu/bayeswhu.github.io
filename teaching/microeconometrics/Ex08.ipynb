    "This question considers the same earnings-schooling dataset as that analyzed in Cameron and Trivedi (2005, 111). The data are in `mus06klingdata.dta`.

Interest lies in the coefficient of schooling. Perform appropriate diagnostics and tests for weak instruments for the following model. The following commands yield the IV estimator:"

    "When an endogenous variable enters the regression nonlinearly, the obvious IV estimator is inconsistent and a modification is needed. Specifically, suppose $y_1 = \\beta y_2^2 + u$, and the first-stage equation for $y_2$ is $y_2 = \\pi z + v$, where the zero mean errors u and v are correlated. Here the endogenous regressor appears in the structural equation as $y_2^2$ rather than $y_2$. The IV estimator is $\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} = (\\sum_i z_i y_{2i}^2)^{-1}\\sum_i z_i y_{1i}$· This can be implemented by a regular IV regression of y on $y_2^2$ with the instrument z: regress $y_2^2$ on z and then regress $y_1$ on the first stage\n",
    "prediction $\\hat{y_2^2}$. If instead we regress $y_2$ on z at the first stage, giving $\\hat{y}_2$, and then regress $y_1$ on $(\\hat{y}_2)^2$, an inconsistent estimate is obtained. Generate a simulation sample to demonstrate these points. Consider whether this example can be generalized to other nonlinear models where the nonlinearity is in regressors only, so that $y_1 = g(y_2)'\\beta + u$, where $g(y_2)$ is a nonlinear function of $y_2$·"
